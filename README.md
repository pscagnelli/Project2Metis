#  What makes and doesnâ€™t make movies money?
The purpose of this project was to scrape movie data from Boxofficemojo.com to predict new ways of making money for movies. I scraped 3000 movies and orgainized them into a Dataframe looking at different features, such as rating, month of release, and year of release, to interpret any new ways of finding revenue sources. Throughout the project, techniques of studying this data included lasso,linear, polynomial, and ridge regression. The project utilizes the concepts of data spliting on the data in order to accurately test datasets for real world use. Attached are files including the code and presentation for the project. Libraries used include numpy, pandas, scikit learn,seaborn and matplotlib. The impacts are to show different sources of revenue and explore different interpretations of data to help the movie industry.
